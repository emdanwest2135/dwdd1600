            <h1> Ann Cleeves Author of the hit tv show Shetland </h1>
            <p>Ann grew up in the country, first in Herefordshire, then in North Devon. Her father was a village school teacher. After dropping out of university she took a number of temporary jobs - child care officer, women's refuge leader, bird observatory cook, auxiliary coastguard - before going back to college and training to be a probation officer.While she was cooking in the Bird Observatory on Fair Isle, she met her husband Tim, a visiting ornithologist. She was attracted less by the ornithology than the bottle of malt whisky she saw in his rucksack when she showed him his room. Soon after they married, Tim was appointed as warden of Hilbre, a tiny tidal island nature reserve in the Dee Estuary. They were the only residents, there was no mains electricity or water and access to the mainland was at low tide across the shore. If a person's not heavily into birds - and Ann isn't - there's not much to do on Hilbre and that was when she started writing. Her first series of crime novels</p>
            
            
            <h2>News for the 8th season of shetland</h2>
            <p>The BBC has finally ended months of speculation, with the announcement of who will replace Jimmy Perez in the hit crime drama Shetland, which has its roots in the award-winning mystery novels by Ann Cleeves.

She will be joining regulars Alison O'Donnell, who plays Tosh, Steven Robertson (Sandy), Lewis Howden (Billy) and Anne Kidd (Cora). The series is written by Paul Logue, who also contributed to the script of series 7, and is currently in preparation.</p>

        <h2>Shetland's Books</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Raven Black</h3>It is a cold January morning and Shetland lies buried beneath a deep layer of snow. Trudging home, Fran Hunter's eye is drawn to a vivid splash of colour on the white ground, ravens circling above. It is the strangled body of her teenage neighbour Catherine Ross. As Fran opens her mouth to scream, the ravens continue their deadly dance...

The locals on the quiet island stubbornly focus their gaze on one man - loner and simpleton Magnus Tait. But when police insist on opening out the investigation a veil of suspicion and fear is thrown over the entire community. For the first time in years, Catherine's neighbours nervously lock their doors, whilst a killer lives on in their midst.</li>
                <li><h3>White Night</h3>When Shetland Detective Jimmy Perez finds a body in a hut used by fishermen it seems to be a straightforward case of suicide. He recognizes the victim - a stranger with amnesia who had disrupted a local party the night before his death.
Yet this is no desperate act of anguish, but the work of a cold and calculating killer. As Perez investigates, he finds himself mired in the hidden secrets of the small biddista community. Then another body is found. Perez knows he must break the cycle before another death occurs. But this is a crazy time of year when night blurs into day and nothing is quite as it seems...</li>
                <li><h3>Red Bones</h3>h3>When an elderly woman is shot in what appears to be a tragic accident, Shetland Detective Jimmy Perez is called to investigate the mystery.
The sparse landscape and the emptiness of the sea have bred a fierce and secretive people. As Jimmy looks to the islanders for answers, he finds instead two feuding families whose envy, greed and bitterness have lasted generations.
Then there's another murder and, as the spring weather shrouds the island in claustrophobic mists, Jimmy must dig up old secrets to stop a new killer from striking again...</li>
                <li><h3>Blue Lightning</h3> With the autumn storms raging, Fair Isle feels cut off from the rest of the world. Trapped, tension is high and tempers become frayed. Enough to drive someone to murder...
A woman's body is discovered at the renowned Fair Isles Bird Observatory, with feathers threaded through her hair. The islanders react with fear and anger. Detective Jimmy Perez has no support from the mainland and must investigate the old-fashioned way. he soon realizes that this is no crime of passion - but a murder of cold and calculated intention.
There's no way off the island until the storms abate - and so the killer is also trapped, just waiting for the opportunity to strike again.</li>
           
                <li><h3>Dead Water</h3>When journalist Jerry Markham left the islands to make a name for himself in London, he left behind a scandal involving a young girl . . . 
Now, years later, his body has just been found in a traditional Shetland boat, outside the house of the local public prosecutor, and young Detective Inspector Willow Reeves is drafted in to head up the investigation with the help of Inspector Jimmy Perez who is still reeling from the death of his fianc√©e.
Markham had few friends in Shetland, so why was he back?
 Willow and Jimmy are led to Sullum Voe, the heart of Shetland's North Sea oil and gas industry. It soon emerges from their investigation that Markham was chasing a story in his final days. One that must have been significant enough to warrant his death . . .</li>
               
                <li><h3> Thin Air </h3> A group of old university friends leave the bright lights of London and travel to Unst, Shetland's most northerly island, to celebrate the marriage of one of their friends to a Shetlander. But late on the night of the wedding party, one of them, Eleanor, disappears - apparently into thin air. The following day, Eleanor's friend Polly receives an email. It appears to be a suicide note, saying she'll never be found alive. And then Eleanor's body is discovered, lying in a small loch close to the cliff edge.
Detectives Jimmy Perez and Willow Reeves are dispatched to Unst to investigate. Before she went missing, Eleanor claimed to have seen the ghost of a local child who drowned in the 1920s. Her interest in the ghost had seemed unhealthy - obsessive, even - to her friends: an indication of a troubled mind. But Jimmy and Willow are convinced that there is more to Eleanor's death than they first thought. Is there a secret that lies behind the myth? One so shocking that someone would kill - many years later - to protect?</li> 
                <li><h3>Cold Earth</h3>h3>In the dark days of a Shetland winter, torrential rain triggers a landslide that crosses the main Lerwick-Sumburgh road and sweeps down to the sea.At the burial of his old friend Magnus Tait, Jimmy Perez watches the flood of mud and peaty water smash through a croft house in its path. Everyone thinks the croft is uninhabited, but in the wreckage he finds the body of a dark-haired woman wearing a red silk dress. In his mind, she shares his mediterranean ancestry and soon he becomes obsessed with tracing her identity.
Then it emerges that she was already dead before the landslide hit the house. Perez knows he must find out who she was, and how she died. </li>
                <li><h3>Wild Fire </h3>Drawn by the welcoming reputation of the Shetland Islands, a new English family move to the area to give their autistic son a better life. But when a young nanny's body is found in the barn of their home, rumours of her relationship with the husband spread life wildfire. DI Jimmy Perez is called in, for what could be the most disturbing case of his career.</li>
