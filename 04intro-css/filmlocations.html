          <h1>Shetland's Film locations</h1> 
            <p>Set amidst the rugged and dramatic landscapes of the Shetland Isles, the series was filmed across various locations on these remote Scottish islands for its exterior shots. Situated approximately 168km from mainland Scotland, the interior scenes were shot there. Notable filming spots in Shetland include Fair Isle, Hillswick wildlife sanctuary, Wester Quarff, and Lerwick, with the seventh series even venturing to Lodberries, a quaint village near Lerwick. DI Perezâ€™s residence in the series was filmed in Kilbarchan, Renfrewshire, while the police station scenes were shot in Barrhead, near Paisley. Additional locations featured Irvine Beach in North Ayrshire and Ayr, along the west coast of Ayrshire.</p>
            
                <p>The filming for the seventh series took place around a year ago in August 2021, and Douglas Henshall, who plays the main character DI Perez, shared his experiences of working on these stormy isles. He expressed his ongoing fascination with the region, having explored it for nearly a decade, highlighting the hidden gems and breathtaking wildflowers of the summer season. Henshall also praised the unique pace of life, the stark beauty of the sea, the ever-changing weather, and the overall drama that defines the Shetland Isles.</p>
